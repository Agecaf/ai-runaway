# What is this

This is my entry for the Ludum Dare 39. Hopefully for the compo.

Note: I have not made it a priority for this to be compatible in all browsers.
I'll test it for chrome and firefox.

# Disclaimer

I'm starting with the codebase I made in studious-happiness
https://github.com/Agecaf/studious-happiness .

It really is all about "project hope", in which I want to make a way of
creating bullet hell levels where, instead of updating bullets every frame,
you know the bullets' position now and in the future. It allows for funky
things like time manipulation, but disallows things like bombs.

I'm currently working on passing it to l√∂ve, but the codebase was there in js,
which I think is easier to use for the ludumdare ('cause its in da webs)
