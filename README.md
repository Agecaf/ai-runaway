# What is this

This is my entry for the Ludum Dare 39. https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/ai-overlord-runaway

Note: I have not made it a priority for this to be compatible in all browsers.
I'll test it for chrome and firefox.

# Disclaimer

I'm starting with the codebase I made in studious-happiness
https://github.com/Agecaf/studious-happiness .

It really is all about "project hope", in which I want to make a way of
creating bullet hell levels where, instead of updating bullets every frame,
you know the bullets' position now and in the future. It allows for funky
things like time manipulation, but disallows things like bombs.

I'm currently working on passing it to l√∂ve, but the codebase was there in js,
which I think is easier to use for the ludumdare ('cause its in da webs)

# License
Other than, the things not in the repo (e.g. fonts used, font-awsome icons, etc.), everything else is covered by the CC0 License. This includes

- The assets; both the SVG images and the Nigh Escape song. I'd publish them in OpenGameArt but I didn't manage to do it last time so I'm not really going to bother.

- The code. Note that some of it is taken from studious-happiness, which is also under the CC0. It's a mess though, so I'd recommend using studious-happiness instead. That being said, I'm planning to move the codebase to Typescript because development would be much easier with proper types for debugging purposes.

- The HTML and CSS. Not sure why you'd want that though. Just make sure you're not using the fonts/etc. for things you cannot use (check their licenses).
